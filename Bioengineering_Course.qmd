## About Our Week

We are excited to have you us this week for our course that combines engineering with practical electrical and programming skills, focused on building sensors for biological applications! In this course, you will be constructing an oxygen biosensor, starting with instrument design and ultimately conducting a scientific experiment with your instrument. We will be working in small groups for the week, and you will be led by a team of engineers and biologists who are developing sensors as part of a National Science Foundation-funded research project. Get ready for a week of engineering fun and hands-on learning!

## Getting Started & Reminders

-   We will be in the lab during much of the week, so please remember to wear long pants and close-toed shoes each day!

-   We will be reimbursing you for parking each day - be sure to check in with Liz regarding reimbursement.

-   We will be accessing this online resource during the week and using USD computers in the week. Your work is not saved on the computer at the end of the day, so please remember to save your files/work on the provided thumb drive!

-   Day 1: We will be conducting a pre-and post-survey as part of this course. Please complete the following when indicated by your instructors: [Pre-Course Survey](https://forms.gle/CPRniVJ7WStf1Z1w8)

## Your Instructors

**Cassondra Williams**: Cassondraâ€™s work focuses on understanding baseline physiology in diving animals and how physiological responses are altered from natural or anthropogenic disturbances. Her past work includes investigating cardiovascular responses to routine and anthropogenic disturbances in marine and freshwater turtles. She has also studied respiratory function in diving emperor penguins and muscle and cardiovascular physiology of diving northern elephant seals after natural disturbances.
