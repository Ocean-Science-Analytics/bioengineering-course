## Measuring Oxygen Levels with Xiao nRF52 and Porphyrin Dyes

Today you will learn how to use the Xiao nRF52 microcontroller and porphyrin dyes to measure oxygen levels using a transimpedance operational amplifier (op amp) circuit and an LED. This hands-on practice will enhance your skills in combining microcontroller programming with chemical sensors for practical applications. Understanding this integration will prepare you for advanced projects in environmental monitoring and sensor technology.
