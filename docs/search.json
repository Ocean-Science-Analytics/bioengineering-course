In this course, you will be constructing an oxygen biosensor, starting with instrument design and ultimately conducting a scientific experiment with your instrument. We will be working in small groups for the week, and you will be led by a team of engineers and biologists who are developing sensors as part of a National Science Foundation-funded research project. Get ready for a week of engineering fun and hands-on learning!",
