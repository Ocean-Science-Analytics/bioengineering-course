This course is an an innovative camp experience that combines engineering with practical electrical and programming skills, focusing on building sensors for biological applications. 
Participants engage in hands-on activities, such as constructing their own oxygen biosensor and mastering essential techniques like soldering, programming, pipetting, and microscopy. 
From starting from scratch to designing and conducting their own experiments, campers will gain valuable insights into the scientific method and data analysis. 
With a small student-to-instructor ratio, attendees will receive personalized mentoring from bioengineers, researchers, and biologists, providing a unique opportunity to explore 
careers in bioengineering, research, and biology.
